In my reserach I am interested in the presence of uncertainty and physical or economic risks in environmental and natural resource systems. In my dissertation research I make use of econometric methods to understand the willingness of fishers to accept fatality risk given institutional constraints and incentives. This research contributes to our understanding of how firms manage physical risk in production processes.
