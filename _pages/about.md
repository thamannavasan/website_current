# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: In my reserach I am interested in the presence of uncertainty and physical or economic risks in natural resource environments due to climate change. More broadly, I am interested in how communities are impacted by climate change and the way we manage natural resources. In my dissertation research I make use of econometric methods and bioeconomic modeling (stochastic dynamic programming) to understand the willingness of fishers to accept fatality risk and the value of harmful algal bloom forecasts.

In my research I am interested in the presence of uncertainty and physical or economic risks in environmental and natural resource systems. In my dissertation research I make use of econometric methods to understand the willingness of fishers to accept fatality risk given institutional constraints and incentives. This research contributes to our understanding of how firms manage physical risk in production processes. 

I will be on the job market in the 2022/2023 AY and will be available for interviews at the Southern Economic Association and the ASSA annual meeting.
