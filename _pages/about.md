I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Applied Economics Department at Oregon State University. I am primarily interested in the economics of resource management, environmental policy evaluation, health, and climate change. My current research uses econometric and revealed preference methods to answer policy-relevant questions about how individuals respond to incentives given technical and institutional constraints. In my job market paper, I measure how commercial vessels respond to increasingly hazardous conditions at sea, given the constraints they face in production due to the management of fisheries. This research contributes to our understanding of how firms manage physical risk in production processes. 

I will be on the job market in the 2022/2023 AY and will be available for interviews at the Southern Economic Association and the ASSA annual meeting.
