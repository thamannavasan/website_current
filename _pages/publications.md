**Fish or Flight: The Role of Accident Risk in Commercial Fishing Trip Duration (JMP)** <br>
Thamanna Vasan (2022) <br>
Abstract: Firms face many competing incentives when managing workplace accident risk. This is especially true in industries where hazard exposure is closely related to a firm’s production choices, as is the case in commercial fishing. This paper examines vessels’ short-run decisions in response to increasing current and future period wave and swell heights. Given an increase in current period conditions, I find that vessels face an incentive to increase their exposure to hazards in order to continue fishing. A marginal increase in current period hazards from the average results in a 4.9 percent increase in the likelihood that a vessel will continue fishing. This result, and the heterogeneity in the response in specifications that explore the role of incentives, indicates that vessels have a short-run incentive to keep fishing and increase exposure to risk. However, when using a forward-looking proxy for near-term forecasts, I find that vessels are far more likely to end a trip early, given a marginal increase in wave heights. Vessels are 22.1 percent less likely to continue a trip, given a marginal increase in wave heights between the current and the next period. I also find significant heterogeneity in the average vessel response given the variation in vessel season length, input controls, and expected ex-vessel prices. Vessels that exit the fishery early are nearly three times more likely to end a trip in response to worsening near-future hazards than vessels that stay in the fishery for the entire season, and increased flexibility around input allocation further reduce the opportunity cost of fishing for most vessels.

Abstract: Commercial fishers are constantly exposed to many risk factors, making it a dangerous occupation. Fisheries management that limits access and catches can give rise to well-known stock and rule-of-capture externalities known as the “race to fish.” This market failure dissipates rents and can lead fishers to take on additional risks such as fishing in poor weather, overloading vessels, or delaying maintenance to outcompete others. Rights-based management is expected to reduce the incentives to take on additional risk. Using a large dataset of fishers from around the United States, we empirically estimate the effects of individual fishing quota (IFQ) programs on one important risk factor: the decision to fish in poor weather. We find that risk-taking behavior generally decreases under IFQs, but the magnitude of the shift differs by fishery, and we explore potential drivers of these differences.
