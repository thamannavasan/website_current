**Fish or Flight: The Role of Accident Risk in Commercial Fishing Trip Duration (JMP)** <br>
Thamanna Vasan (2022) <br>
Abstract: Firms face many competing incentives when managing workplace accident risk. This is especially true in industries where hazard exposure is closely related to a firm’s production choices, as is the case in commercial fishing. This paper examines vessels’ short-run decisions in response to increasing current and future period wave and swell heights. Given an increase in current period conditions, I find that vessels face an incentive to increase their exposure to hazards in order to continue fishing. A marginal increase in current period hazards from the average results in a 4.9 percent increase in the likelihood that a vessel will continue fishing. This result, and the heterogeneity in the response in specifications that explore the role of incentives, indicates that vessels have a short-run incentive to keep fishing and increase exposure to risk. However, when using a forward-looking proxy for near-term forecasts, I find that vessels are far more likely to end a trip early, given a marginal increase in wave heights. Vessels are 22.1 percent less likely to continue a trip, given a marginal increase in wave heights between the current and the next period. I also find significant heterogeneity in the average vessel response given the variation in vessel season length, input controls, and expected ex-vessel prices. Vessels that exit the fishery early are nearly three times more likely to end a trip in response to worsening near-future hazards than vessels that stay in the fishery for the entire season, and increased flexibility around input allocation further reduce the opportunity cost of fishing for most vessels.
